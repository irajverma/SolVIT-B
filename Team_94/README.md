# NoQ
## Dynamic Queue System

## Deployment: noq-hawks.vercel.app

The NoQ Dynamic Queue System allows for a wide way of virtual queues to be implemented.
## User App:

    User logs in and selects the service (bank counter, doctor, store billing counter, etc.)
    Books a virtual token for their visit
    The app shows real-time queue status and estimated waiting time, reminders/notifications as turn approaches - cancel/reschedule as needed
    Time slots are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.

## Service Provider Dashboard:

    Current queue status
    Crowdsourced data of people waiting , served, and pending (collected from users of NoQ)
    AI-based analysis of peak times and crowd prediction (potential)
    Public Transport Integration (alternative application):
    Syncs with public transport API like Open Transit Data (DMRC)
    Best transport routes and timings for the user’s booked slot
    Avoid delays due to transportation issues
